# BlockChain

This program mimics BlockChain Technology which is a growing list of records of blocks that utilize cryptography. Each block consists of transactions between user's and these transactions are made up of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. This is a program that generates a basic blockchain and utilizes hashes, transaction hashes and transactions to ensure the authenticity of the block and allows a user to perform transactions on blocks of their choice. The 256-bit hashes in this program are generated by the same algorithm that generates the hashes in a real blockchain, the SHA-256 algorithm! 

First, the gif below generates a blockchain of length specified by the user. No transactions were made and notice how each block has a unique hash which was generated by the SHA-256 algorithm. In addition, the chain is valid since the hashes generated by the SHA-256 algorithm were not altered.

Next, we are going to perform a transaction on a block specified by the user. The amount of Ledger Dollars the user has updates and the block the transaction performed on now has a unique transaction hash which was also generated by the SHA-256 algorithm, except for transactions the SHA-256 algorithm is applied twice.

Now, the user has decided to alter a hash at Block 3. The block they chose to alter has a different hash value than the one that would have been generated by the SHA-256 algorithm and will cause the chain to be invalid, resulting in all transactions on this chain being invalid.
