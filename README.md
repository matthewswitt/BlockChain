# BlockChain

This program mimics BlockChain Technology which is a growing list of records of blocks that utilize cryptography. Each block consists of transactions between user's and these transactions are made up of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. This is a program that generates a basic blockchain and utilizes hashes, transaction hashes and transactions to ensure the authenticity of the block. The 256-bit hashes in this program are generated by the same algorithm that generates the hashes in a real blockchain, the SHA-256 algorithm! 

First, the gif below generates a blockchain of length specified by the user. No transactions were made and notice how each block has a unique hash which was generated by the SHA-256 algorithm.
